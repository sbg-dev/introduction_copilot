GitHub Copilot is used by over 1 million individual developers and tens of thousands of businesses, including over 50,000 paying business customers. 

According to a 2023 Stack Overflow survey, 55% of developers prefer Copilot as an AI programming assistant.

Copilot analyzes the context in the editor, including open files and dependencies, to generate suggestions probabilistically without copying code. 

With Copilot Enterprise, companies can customize Copilot to their codebase and processes. This includes creating fine-tuned private models.

Copilot collects user data like interactions and prompts to improve the experience. Feedback can be voluntarily submitted.

The Copilot Trust Center describes GitHub's commitments to privacy, such as excluding enterprise data from training.

Regular blog posts provide information on Copilot research, customer stories, and AI trends for developers.

The overall goal of Copilot is to help developers code happier and faster by automating routine tasks and providing context-aware assistance.

- Copilot is trained continuously on public code from GitHub and other sources to improve its suggestions over time. However, it does not directly copy or store code.

- Suggestions are generated based on a probabilistic understanding of context rather than memorizing snippets. This allows Copilot to adapt to different codebases and styles.

- In addition to code completions, Copilot provides chat assistance directly in IDEs, terminals, and GitHub.com. Developers can ask questions about their codebase. 

- Copilot is designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest. It aims to avoid insecure or unethical suggestions through techniques like constitutional AI.

- GitHub does not use Copilot Business or Enterprise customer data to train models. Customer data is only used to operate and improve the paid services.

- Research shows using Copilot can significantly boost productivity, job satisfaction, and code quality while reducing bugs. It helps developers focus on higher-level work.

- Additional paid features in Copilot Enterprise include custom models, integrated chat on GitHub.com, and tailored documentation search.

- GitHub offers professional services like guided workshops to help organizations adopt Copilot and maximize its benefits.

- The Copilot product is continually expanding to more languages, platforms, and use cases based on customer and market feedback.
