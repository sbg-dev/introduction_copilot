# introduction_copilot

This repository was used the present GitHub Copilot in a live demo.

There are two branches main and wissenstransfer20240319:
- In wissenstransfer20240319 you can find the code that was used in the live demo.
- In main you can find the code that was used in a training session.  
If you compare the two branches you can see the differences between two sessions using GitHub Copilot.
These approaches do the same thing but the code is different. Especially the cmake code.

The presentation can be found on the main branch in the [doc](./doc/) folder.
